Erik gives us a brief story about nearly being kidnapped abroad, and then we dive more into how to market during social distancing. Erik emphasizes that things are changing weekly, and authenticity is now more important than ever. The phrases &#8220;we&#8217;re in this together&#8221; and &#8220;uncertain times&#8221; have been used to exhaustion. Think about your customers, think about what they&#8217;re going through, and craft messaging that meets them where they are and stays true to your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Next, we discuss strategies and tactics for filling the gap in the pipeline caused by cancelled events and other top of funnel channels that have been impacted by COVID-19. We talk through this from a couple different vantage points &#8211; companies that are already doing a fair bit of digital marketing as well as companies who are trying to accelerate and catch up on their digital strategy. Erik emphasizes the importance of thinking critically about what you used to get out of the event or lead channel and how are you going to replace it by reinvesting those marketing dollars elsewhere. As an example, Erik traditionally has traveled all over to speak and network at conferences. When thinking about how to reinvest those T&amp;E and marketing dollars, you wouldn&#8217;t put that money into a Google Ad campaign because it&#8217;s not going to have the same end result. If you went to conferences to network, build relationships, and promote your brand as a thought leader in your space, get creative about redeploying those dollars elsewhere to have a similar benefit. In Erik&#8217;s case, he&#8217;s been trying new things like hosting small, intimate virtual dinners with a handful of executives in a particular industry.<\/p>\n<p>We wrap up the podcast talking about the top mistakes Erik sees companies making right now, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/marketing\/marketing-hacks-for-founders\/\">actionable tips<\/a>, tricks, and <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/sales\/2019-startup-sales-stack-report\/\">software tools<\/a> to help companies as they tackle how to market during social distancing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"CToWUd a6T alignleft\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/mail.google.com\/mail\/u\/0?ui=2&amp;ik=3d38556bc0&amp;attid=0.1&amp;permmsgid=msg-a:r-2708086886111657196&amp;th=1722d48b1dde27c6&amp;view=fimg&amp;sz=s0-l75-ft&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ_ca6KsJQcxt7eCF_i6ZhzyKz7N8sE5H3MnVIrmg8L0aLTTIos38DAFv-6Yz5tX8Sg0ESxDMxJE9vYnWjgYEdrAtNqlby-1mdJBFVoD11bokODBuqfQNeQMoME&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=ii_kadzy2ww0\" alt=\"0-2.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" data-image-whitelisted=\"\" \/>Named to Forbes 30 Under 30, Erik Huberman is a brand marketing expert, serial entrepreneur, and founder of Hawke Media, the fastest-growing digital marketing agency in Los Angeles.

David walks us through a few key questions to think about: what is my current runway status, how have my customers&#8217; behaviors changed, what are my competitors doing (at a macro <em>and<\/em> micro level), and what is happening to ad pricing and the cost of other unique marketing opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Filling top of funnel after cancelled in-person events<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Next we dig into how to make up for the lost leads that were going to come from in-person events. David stresses that the most important thing is to identify where your customers are spending their time <em>now<\/em>. Instead of attending a conference, those same attendees are now presumably sitting at home at their computer. Many companies are reinvesting their resources into content, and David has seen a rise in webinars and white papers as a result. There are also other opportunities within media where other companies are pulling back. For instance, David has seen some clients pause media spend nearly 100%. What&#8217;s that trend mean for you? Well, two months ago, you might have been lucky to get the fourth or fifth position on Google and paid advertising for a really high-value keyword that would drive a lot of conversions for you. Now that same keyword may be available in first position for 75% of what you paid for in fourth position.\u00a0When thinking about taking advantage of lower cost-per-click (CPC) rates, David emphasizes the importance of also taking into account the LTV of the new cohort of customers you are signing on. CPC (and CAC) are just one side of the equation and are not enough information to make a decision by themselves. For instance, if your CPC is down 50%, but LTV is down 70%, then piling more money into paid search\/media is not a good decision.<\/p>\n<p>There are also plenty of levers marketing leaders can leverage that don&#8217;t require more money for growth marketing during COVID-19. David is seeing 3Q clients reinvest their time in the following: enhancements to their SEO, going through their site and cleaning it up, writing content that&#8217;s going to get them ranked organically so they don&#8217;t have to pay for the traffic, conversion rate optimization, testing their homepage, testing their landing page, testing their messaging, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Navigating webinar fatigue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There has been a record surge in the amount of free webinars produced in the past couple of months. You can hear a guest speaker give a keynote that you would normally have to pay thousands of dollars to see at a conference (plus travel costs), for free on a webinar that you can watch from home. So the question then becomes &#8211; with so much good content out there and webinar fatigue starting to set in, is this event\/webinar\/etc. worth producing? The best piece of advice David has heard is if you received an invite to your own webinar in your email box, would you read about the webinar and would you share it with six of your business colleagues? If the answer is no, it&#8217;s probably not content that is going to get a lot of traction. Use yourself as a litmus test to narrow in on the highest value content and virtual events.<\/p>\n<p>The second big piece of advice here is to use your own unique insights and data to make the webinar actionable. For instance, at 3Q Digital they have been mining their own data to provide actionable insights as to where things are directionally going and aggregating the content on a <a href=\"https:\/\/3qdigital.com\/resources\/covid19marketing\/\">COVID-19 page<\/a>. Instead of using a generic title like &#8220;COVID-19: How this will change SaaS marketing forever,&#8221; try something like &#8220;COVID-19 Spending: An analysis of $20M of spend over the past six weeks.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Avoiding common mistakes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The top mistake David sees is the emphasis on the macro, not the micro. For instance, some companies are using the &#8220;overall economy is down&#8221; as the main point of optimization and not the data they&#8217;re seeing from their own accounts and their own analytics. Another common mistake is not looking at your data on a\u00a0<em>very<\/em> regular basis (much more frequently that you otherwise would). 3Q Digital encourages their clients to look at their data on a daily basis and pivot if necessary on a daily basis. This includes query identification of what&#8217;s trending and acting on that, adjusting budgets based on how LTV is changing, and tweaking messaging to make sure that it is appropriate to the times. Lastly, another big mistake is to isolate yourself and not be concerned about what competitors are doing. A lot of companies are changing their offering (offering free trials) and discounting their pricing. It is imperative that you stay on top of what your competitors are doing so that you can keep up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Updating messaging\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>David often talks with customers about <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/podcasts\/communicating-with-customers-during-covid-19\/\">messaging<\/a> in their ad texts. He has historically said that there are four emotions that will sell anything: fear, greed, vanity, and exclusivity. However, in these times those emotions in ad texts would come off as tone-deaf. David has come up with a new set of four emotions for growth marketing during COVID-19: safety, ease, risk-free, and flexibility. As you think about what you&#8217;re messaging to consumers, think about how you can create ad text, landing pages, emails, and webinars that are making them feel in some ways better and less stressed out.<\/p>\n<p>We wrap up the podcast with David&#8217;s final tips and tricks: 1) avoid herd mentality, 2) strive to be a profit center not a cost center, and 3) the person with the best data wins.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-20166 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/0-1-1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Growth Marketing During COVID-19\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/0-1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/0-1-1-58x58.jpg 58w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/0-1-1.jpg 412w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>David Rodnitzky is founder and CEO of 3Q Digital, a leading growth marketing agency, that works with the world&#8217;s most innovative clients.

Jason stresses the importance of communication during such an important and dynamic time, but cautions companies against rushing to get a message out the door. Take a step back and be thoughtful with your messaging and how you are delivering it. It&#8217;s also important that you put your customers first and not over-focus on specific marketing metrics (open rates, click rates, etc.), because you can have a bunch of people open your emails and subsequently be left a bad taste in their mouth which diminishes your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Next, we start to discuss best practices based on the large swath of data from ActiveCampaign&#8217;s customers. Get as personal as possible (both in terms of how segmenting customers) but also in terms of how it&#8217;s getting delivered. Jason recommends sending emails from a person (vs. a generic company inbox) and have the replies go to that individual if you can. Lose the heavily formatted, corporate-feeling email and go with a plain, simple template. The fact that it looks a little imperfect will actually help you come across as personal in your outreach.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to personalization at scale, Jason suggests splicing your customers as narrowly as possible. It will take longer to get the messaging out and curate your content, but it won&#8217;t go unnoticed. Instead of shooting from the hip with messaging that will be relevant for 50-60% of your customer base, bring that into a smaller grouping so that you can hone your messaging to be relevant and helpful for your audience. Another best practice he is seeing emerge is having an individual actually talk to that specific customer. It&#8217;s a heavier lift, but when done right it comes off as extremely personal and helpful. Leading with value instead of the hard pitch is now more applicable than ever. For example, if you are a vertical SaaS company, lead with new ideas and helpful insights about the industry instead of talking about your services. This may sound basic, but it&#8217;s important to come back to the fundamentals here.<\/p>\n<p>Next, we tackle how to address potentially over-communicating with customers. His basic rule of thumb: if there&#8217;s no value to share, don&#8217;t message. Fewer messages fine-tuned for the smallest audience possible is far superior to messages sent in bulk large generic groups.<\/p>\n<p>Another common mistake Jason sees is companies not engaging as much as they should out of fear of contraction or churn. Now is the time to lean in and build goodwill, not shy away from a potential churn conversation. Get creative, offer credits, etc. to see how you can maintain logos who are struggling. Be upfront with your customers and they&#8217;ll remember you for it.<\/p>\n<p>One helpful tip when crafting your customer communication strategy: map out your customer journey. Especially as you scale, you have different teams communicating with customers across different channels with different systems. When you fully understand the journey someone goes through as a customer, you&#8217;ll often have an a-ha moment of what you&#8217;re either missing or what you&#8217;re overdoing.<\/p>\n<p>We wrap things up with some parting advice &#8211; while it may go against instinct, especially at a time like this, but less messaging is far more effective. People&#8217;s perception of your brand and customer advocacy of your brand can be destroyed much faster than it&#8217;s created, so really take the time to get your messaging right, which starts with getting your company&#8217;s culture and approach to messaging right.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-20160 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/JVB-Headshot_FULL_IMG_2600jpg-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Communicating with customers during covid-19\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/JVB-Headshot_FULL_IMG_2600jpg-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/JVB-Headshot_FULL_IMG_2600jpg-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/JVB-Headshot_FULL_IMG_2600jpg-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/JVB-Headshot_FULL_IMG_2600jpg-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/JVB-Headshot_FULL_IMG_2600jpg-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Jason VandeBoom is the Founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.activecampaign.com\/\">ActiveCampaign<\/a>.

In the 8 years that I\u2019ve lived here, I\u2019ve gone out just about every 2nd day with the exception of the odd week where I might be sick or readjusting from travel. This is the reality of most New Yorkers given the plethora of activities and restaurants at our doorstep. There\u2019s a reason why this is called the city that doesn\u2019t sleep. While this is the reality of the New York lifestyle, the rest of the world is wired a little differently. Where I\u2019m originally from, Sydney, Australia, lockdown is kind of similar to most weekdays in that there are limited things to do after work so you&#8217;re most likely heading home. Not to mention, space is a given. It\u2019s no secret that space is not a luxury for many New Yorkers, after all, who needs space when you\u2019re mainly there to sleep? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It got me thinking about how other New Yorkers (who did not flee the city) are staying sane during shelter in place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going on day 50+ of self isolation, I know I\u2019m personally beginning to struggle. My Managing Partner asked me in our 1:1 how I\u2019m doing and how\u2019s my mental health. Truthfully, I almost cried and then proceeded to talk through all the things I\u2019m grateful for and why I shouldn\u2019t complain. I\u2019ve always lived alone in my New York life and I\u2019ve always appreciated this because\u2026 well I had the luxury of coming home to my own oasis away from the hustle and bustle. Now this is all I have, sans hustle and bustle. As someone who thrives off of other people\u2019s energy and is taking lockdown very seriously, it\u2019s admittedly getting tough and the end is at <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">minimum<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> another 30 days away. I can\u2019t be the only one in this boat so I\u2019m setting out to find different folks in New York who are open to sharing their story on how they\u2019re staying sane during shelter in place from the new epicentre of the crisis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To kick things off, I\u2019m sharing how I\u2019ve managed to get through 50+ days of self-isolation <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as a single person household in NYC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Morning Routine<\/strong> &#8211; Every day, I insist on my typical morning routine. I wake up, shower, put my makeup on (I\u2019m on video calls all day and for my sanity I need this!), pick out my sweats for the day (nope, none of them are tye-dye), make breakfast (which is new to my routine, usually I just make matcha or coffee), Instagram story my breakfast \/ workstation (also new and worth noting that I\u2019m a wannabe food blogger so food always eats first) and then my work day starts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m fortunate that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work is only a 7 minute walk for me so I&#8217;ve never had to factor in much of a commute. Now with those 7 minutes I can fit in breakfast and am really appreciating why it&#8217;s the most important meal of the day. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Documenting my breakfast \/ workstation might seem silly but it has helped me count the days and I always add a song which is reflective of how I\u2019m feeling that day. It\u2019s somewhat cathartic and I kind of want to remember this period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Violin<\/strong> &#8211; I\u2019ve played violin since I was 5 years old and since moving here I have only played it a handful of times. Fortunately, when you start playing an instrument early in life I think it\u2019s hard to lose the skill, but I was 100% rusty. This has turned into endless hours of practicing and video calls with my sister who acts as a quasi-teacher. I love classical violin music and spending my time practicing \/ learning pieces helps me step away from work and invest in a creative skill that\u2019s been put to the side. Personally, there\u2019s something very rewarding about this and I\u2019m grateful to now have the time to focus on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-20126 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/8C3EEA21-DBE1-4790-B22D-981A42B51B02-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Check-in With Yourself - Shelter In Place - Bowery Capital\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/8C3EEA21-DBE1-4790-B22D-981A42B51B02-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/8C3EEA21-DBE1-4790-B22D-981A42B51B02-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/8C3EEA21-DBE1-4790-B22D-981A42B51B02-600x800.jpg 600w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/8C3EEA21-DBE1-4790-B22D-981A42B51B02-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/8C3EEA21-DBE1-4790-B22D-981A42B51B02.jpg 1512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/>Cooking<\/strong> &#8211; I eat the majority of my meals out and as a wannabe food blogger I\u2019m on an endless quest for finding delicious (and aesthetically pleasing) meals. Obviously lockdown means I can\u2019t eat out, but as a true foodie I\u2019m not letting this stop me\u2026 I just have to make them myself. Every week, I plan out 2-3 meals I want to make, write out my grocery list and on Saturday mornings before the rush and when the store seems to be full of supply, I pick up all my ingredients. If you\u2019re a one person home like me, you will want to half the recipe or you\u2019ll be eating 1 meal with leftovers for the week. Every week I gain more confidence and attempt making something more challenging. I\u2019m getting to the point where I\u2019m really appreciating eating at home and dare I say, I think my food is restaurant quality! Ok, it\u2019s probably on the level of fast to casual dining. I think it\u2019s rewarding to see a skill come into fruition that I have never been that excited about that feeds into things I love.

It was fun until it became a little exhausting. Two things I\u2019m craving more than ever is connection and making sure people are doing okay, but for it to consume my entire life outside of work wasn\u2019t feeding me. So video calls now happen sporadically throughout the week and I rarely go from one call to the next. I\u2019m starting to figure out a good balance of work, family, social and me time and part of that is reflecting on how certain activities make me feel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Overthrow<\/strong> &#8211; My favorite workout is boxing at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/overthrownyc.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overthrow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and fortunately they spun up a digital platform overnight.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think it\u2019s easy to forget how energized you can feel after a good workout with your favorite instructor. I know I did until I did his full class via Instagram Stories. While there are on-demand workouts available through their home school app, doing the class while he was live was the most motivated I\u2019d been\u2026 maybe because you can\u2019t really press pause, you just have to keep going. So I\u2019m going to try and prioritize whenever my boxing instructor is live on Instagram Stories because being somewhat active while stuck indoors is important for your mental and physical health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Doing Nothing<\/strong> &#8211; There are nights \/ weekends when I just do nothing. I don\u2019t work, cook, clean, talk to anyone, play violin or work out. I just sit and listen to music, watch tv, read, nap, stare out the window, or spend endless hours scrolling through Tik Tok. Yes, I am a 30+ year old on Tik Tok and I\u2019m not ashamed to say that it\u2019s been particularly entertaining during self isolation. While connection and creativity are important, sometimes you just need to do nothing to balance out your day \/ week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like all things in life, continuing to have balance is important. It\u2019s just a matter of figuring out ways to create this from the inside of your home especially if you\u2019re a one person home in an NYC apartment. And while I am starting to feel the weight of this solitude lifestyle, I think it\u2019s important more than ever to be self aware of how you feel. Allow yourself to feel that way, don\u2019t be afraid to talk about it, and figure out ways you can direct that energy into activities that make you feel good and sane while practicing social distancing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before I wrap up, if you need help in finding some zen whether you\u2019re in a five person household or one, check out <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/ny\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Headspace<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

They are able to analyze such a large amount of data that any seller should pay attention to the outputs. Russ spent a bit of time talking about what makes for effective content at a high level. How long people view your sales deck, what material within matters and what does not, and finally what is the most effective areas DocSend sees in decks. Within this, we cover pricing and case studies as areas that are the highest performing types of content. Russ and I then covered what he is seeing around COVID-19 and content effectiveness during COVID-19. Russ covers viewing pattern changes, industry (i.e. media or hospitality) issues within their sales decks, and finally pipeline and how he has seen re-prioritization and deal closing from prospects. We then moved on to how sellers need to adapt their content to this &#8220;new normal&#8221; and where the focus will be in the coming months and years. While not specific to the topic, Russ and I closed on some details on fundraising data and what he is seeing in the short term as it relates to entrepreneurs raising money.

Accelerate covers sales, marketing, hiring, and fundraising in a weekly workshop environment. We are planning to host it in-person in New York, NY from July\u200a\u2014\u200aAugust 2020, but we have a backup plan to host it remotely over Zoom if need be. Now more than ever, it\u2019s important to support entrepreneurs on their journey of learning how to build a disciplined business that\u2019s ready to sell and market their products for the long haul.

Some fun snippets from last year\u2019s program: one founder started negotiating an acquisition offer, another founder started raising a $5M seed round, two founders had babies mid-program, multiple founders landed their first big deals (some in the six-figure range), and another founder was selected to participate on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetthedrapers.com\/\">Meet The Drapers<\/a> and we helped her craft her pitch and story.

One thing is clear &#8211; there is always room for improvement. Additionally, the bar for seed-funded B2B SaaS companies continues to rise &#8211; in 2010, only 9% of seed-funded companies were generating revenue; today, over half of them are. Whether you are looking to hone in on your ICP and target buyer persona, iron out your first contracts, build out a <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/acceleration-team\/building-your-bd-lead-engine-top-5-mistakes-to-avoid\/\">channel sales strategy<\/a>, hire and ramp your first sales rep, or build a repeatable process that employees, investors, and customers alike can believe in, we are excited to share best practices that you can immediately apply to your business. We&#8217;ll provide the lessons you&#8217;ll need through this comprehensive bootcamp to help you get the revenue traction needed to raise seed and Series A rounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>WHO [should apply]<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accelerate is for pre-seed B2B founders.

This is also an opportunity to network with 20 top pre-seed founders, Bowery Capital\u2019s investment team, SVB\u2019s enterprise sector team, and sales leaders from the NYC enterprise community.

One could argue some companies are staying neutral in a holding pattern (e.g. just hiring freeze but no layoffs), but we&#8217;ll go ahead and put them in the defense camp. We also discuss what this means for individuals laid off in this environment, and tips for what to do next.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Companies on offense<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Companies playing offense are looking to scoop up talent that recently came onto the market. The thinking here is that a large amount of A and B players have come onto the job market after being laid off. While this is true, companies should still proceed thoughtfully. Before going out to acquire top talent just for the sake of it, ask yourself why do we need this role, why now, and be very intentional about it. Additionally, it&#8217;s a mistake to expect to hire A+ talent for less than A+ pay. Even in the current environment, you&#8217;ll have to pay up for top talent. Amy noted that some companies are using this as an opportunity to &#8220;topgrade,&#8221; bringing in top-quality talent to elevate the current team. Amy has put together <a href=\"https:\/\/openviewpartners.com\/blog\/how-to-hire-enterprise-salespeople\/#.XqBcW9NJG3c\">this guide<\/a> as well as this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saleshacker.com\/hiring-scorecard-sales-process\/\">hiring scorecard<\/a> to help companies hire sales reps during and after COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Companies on defense<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Companies playing defense, which is the majority, are looking to reduce burn and extend runway through hiring freezes, layoffs, furloughs, pay cuts (&#8220;voluntary&#8221; or otherwise), and other means. First things first, Amy recommends not letting fear override sensible decision making. She recommends founders and their executive team use a tool called <a href=\"http:\/\/burnrate.io\">burnrate.io<\/a> to help estimate an accurate burn rate for the coming months. Then, once you&#8217;ve made the tough decision to introduce cost-cutting measure, be very thoughtful about how you go about it. Look at your values, walk your talk, look at the things that you touted in a great economy, and treat your employees with utmost respect and transparency while embodying &#8220;The Golden Rule&#8221; as you think about how to communicate changes internally (and externally). It is also a good opportunity to quadruple down on the team still in place. Remove barriers for them, help them uncover blind spots, and get creative about how you will reward them for sticking it out with the company once we&#8217;re on the other side of this crisis. Another key piece Amy advises companies on is to communicate, communicate, communicate. Leadership should be not only actively communicating what changes are being made, but they should also be proactive about communicating the plan, the vision, and, if possible, how you&#8217;ll reward the team that sees it through to the light at the end of the tunnel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Individuals who have been laid off<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we discuss tips for individuals that have been on the receiving end of company layoffs. First things first, try not to post immediately on LinkedIn when emotions are running high. Take a step back, give yourself several days to process, reflect, think about how you can apply your experience\/learnings to your future employer. When you do start exploring new opportunities and potential employers, use a scorecard to make sure it&#8217;s a good fit. Amy recently revamped her favorite scorecard which you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saleshacker.com\/job-scorecard-template\/\">here<\/a>.

With so many job seekers flooding the market, how do you stand out amongst your peers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We sat down with talent and sales leaders in tech to collect and share their nuggets of advice on interviewing in the time of COVID-19.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/raluongo\/\">Ron Luongo<\/a>, Talent Acquisition Manager at\u00a0 Electric<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSeek out a mentor during this time or catch up with a long lost one. This is a great opportunity to learn from people who have been through challenging times before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leverage your network. Proactively reach out to people \/ companies you are interested in and start the dialogue. If teams are slowing on hiring, they won&#8217;t come to you. This way you&#8217;ll be top of mind for when things pick up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharpen your skills. Take that online class to get certified, learn that new coding language you&#8217;ve been putting off, This is a great opportunity to make yourself the best candidate you can be!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practice makes perfect. If you have some friends who are looking as well, set up a couple of mock interviews with questions you&#8217;re unaware of. This will help keep the rust off and your interview reflexes on point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prioritize what you are looking for. What do you most care about? Leadership, culture, ability to grow? Know what you want this and expect trade offs because of the current climate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, remember these times when you do land your next gig.

Your resume is a representation of yourself and your work experience, use this time to revamp your resume. Check for grammar\/spelling, build out your accomplishments, and tailor it to the company you&#8217;re applying to or the role.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take this opportunity to build relationships with past colleagues and potential new ones.

Use this time to your advantage and organize your thoughts and projects and take the time to really present yourself. Prepare to highlight your strongest accomplishments and how to effectively communicate what your job is and how you collaborate with others. Some of the best conversations I\u2019ve had are with folks in industries that I\u2019ve never had prior experience with. When someone can break down projects that give me the confidence that I can communicate this to another person, then I walk away from that conversation feeling energized about that person.

Now, more than ever, candidates need to be differentiating themselves out of the gate&#8211; make sure your resume has quality metrics, you come into every interview overly prepared and you always send a thoughtful follow up thank you after an interview.

We then dive into each of these a bit further.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Operate with compassion and empathy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Marko discusses why you should start from scratch with your sales and marketing emails &#8211; keeping compassion and empathy at the forefront of your tone and messaging. It may also help to further narrow in on your ICP to focus on the prospects and clients where you are solving for a high-priority pain point during this time as companies have put all &#8220;nice-to-have&#8221; conversations on hold.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Pressure Test Your Pipeline<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We then dig into pressure testing your pipeline &#8211; why it&#8217;s important and how to do it. To start, it&#8217;s important for the team to recognize what they can influence vs. what they can control. One mistake folks make in times of crisis is trying to over-correct and control things that are outside of their control. Instead, focus on things that are well within your control: how frequently you engage prospects, how many contacts you&#8217;re engaged with at an account, how you&#8217;re forecasting deal size and close dates internally, how you set, manage, and execute next steps, as well as how you&#8217;re maintaining a healthy pipeline of realistic deals. Another key mistake right now is sales reps trying to force a purchase or force a demo (i.e. <em>controlling<\/em> the closed sale), when they should be simply trying to add value &#8211; could be through a free pilot or writing an eBook (i.e. <em>influencing<\/em> the deal).<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Change Commercial Terms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Commercial terms are also something that are fully within control of your organization. Marko breaks down how you can think about your commercial terms by first selecting what you want to optimize for: bookings growth, reduce churn, or cash on hand. If optimizing for cash on hand, you might sell an 18-month agreement for the price of a 12-month agreement or sell services and consulting when you otherwise wouldn&#8217;t offer them. If optimizing for bookings growth, you may give flexible payment terms (e.g. net-90) or offer quarterly or monthly payments instead of annual. If optimizing for churn reduction, consider offering 3, 6, or 12-month free extensions to retain the logo and have the ability to renew after the crisis or pause licenses for companies that are taking severe financial hits &#8211; keeping their instance alive for 10% of the regular cost.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Create an Accountable WFH Sales Culture<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Marko sheds light on how sales leaders should be creating an accountable WFH sales culture. The goal here is on a sales culture that is visible, accountable, and focused on a change to the right behaviors. It&#8217;s important to recognize which reps need more structure (typically SDRs), and if so, help them build out their calendar with designated blocks for various activities. 37 Signals has a great book on this, <a href=\"https:\/\/basecamp.com\/books\/remote\">REMOTE<\/a>, which helps explain additional best practices. One of the big shifts Marko sees is the move to asynchronous work, where the team isn&#8217;t necessarily doing the same things at the same time anymore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Move to an Efficiency-Based Model<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we touch on the importance of focusing on an efficiency based model. While companies used to be able to focus on growth at all costs, the focus now has to be on efficiency. Demand-gen budget has been slashed, and you can&#8217;t afford to have a leaky funnel. Instead of looking for one silver bullet, it&#8217;s important to look at all of the incremental improvements you can make at every stage of the funnel. For early stage startups that don&#8217;t have great stage-level data, ask these three questions: why are they going to buy; why are they going to buy now; and why are they going to buy your product? One trick here is to ask yourself, &#8220;what are prospects saying at the end of the call?&#8221; Are they trying to determine use cases and how they would use it or are they asking how much does this cost, who else needs to be in the purchasing process, etc.? Those questions will help clarify whether the prospect understands where your product fits into their life and what next steps should be or perhaps they are still confused.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Additional resources<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1.

We moved on to chat about how Concert Finance and Sanj are advising companies in this environment. Specifically we spent a bit of time going through the changes necessary in your sales playbook as well as your quotas. Third, we walked through the feedback loop that Concert Finance utilizes with their customers. Next we ran through details on how quotas are directly tied to motivation and how you should tactically think about resetting these in your organization. We talked about moving towards a weekly system with your AEs and SDRs and how this can be beneficial in this market. We spoke a bit about top and bottom performers and how to handle them in this environment. Sanj spent a bit of time also talking about CS plans and how you should think about the success metrics in this environment. Towards the end we spent a bit of time talking through activity vs outcome based approaches to compensation. Sanj also mentioned how the CSO Insights survey around quota attainment (50-60% miss) is going to be a good barometer to watch in terms of sales efficiency going forward as we get back to basics in sales. Overall this was a timely podcast and we appreciated Sanj coming on and sharing his insights.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-19778\" src=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Sanj-LinkedIn-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"resetting quotas\" width=\"257\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Sanj-LinkedIn-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Sanj-LinkedIn-300x223.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Sanj-LinkedIn-1024x762.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Sanj-LinkedIn-768x572.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Sanj-LinkedIn-600x447.jpg 600w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Sanj-LinkedIn-1536x1144.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px\" \/>Sanj Sanampudi is co-founder and CEO of Concert,\u00a0an incentive compensation platform built on the science and psychology of performance.\u00a0\u00a0Sanj was a speaker at the 2019 SaaStr Annual and the World at Work Spotlight on Sales Comp.\u00a0 He also co-authored\u00a0the \u201cHow to Create Better Comp Plans in 2020\u201d guide with Modern Sales Pros.

We discuss why marketing attribution has become such a hot topic in recent years, which is largely due to the vast amounts of data that is now available about how prospects are interacting with your company. Then, we start diving into the nitty gritty. There are a myriad of ways to splice up your marketing attribution model. John walks us through some of the most common models used today with the pros and cons of each. We cover when a startup should think about implementing a model marketing attribution, how to actually go about implementing it, as well as who typically owns this responsibility internally.<\/p>\n<p>We wrap up the podcast discussing some of the common pitfalls when implementing (and analyzing the results of) a marketing attribution model and how to avoid them. John stresses the importance of being mindful of what attribution model you have in place when looking at the data, as your attribution model can cause your results to appear bias to certain areas of your funnel. If you lose sight of this, it&#8217;s easy to draw the wrong conclusion from your results.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, John talks about some of the common internal conflicts that can arise with <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/insights\/offline-attribution-measurement\/\">attribution models<\/a> and offers tips for individuals and leadership on how to deal with them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19739 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/0.jpg\" alt=\"marketing attribution\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/0.jpg 200w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/0-58x58.jpg 58w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/>John Fernandez is the SVP Marketing at Glia, an enterprise SaaS platform that enables organizations to engage their online visitors in the same way they would engage them in-person.

This is a summary of what we\u2019re hearing and how we\u2019re seeing best-in-class startups respond:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Top of funnel<\/strong><br \/>\nTop of funnel for most enterprise companies is a mess even if you are succeeding. All activities &#8211; emails, phone calls, are down by 50-80% on average. There\u2019s just a lot in flux and it\u2019s tough to see anyone meeting or beating their activity or outcome numbers this quarter. Interestingly enough, we are hearing of companies see an uptick in F2000 discovery meetings, presumably as individual prospects poke around new technologies while WFH. TBD whether this flows through to closed deals or is just spinning wheels.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bottom of funnel<\/strong><br \/>\nBottom of the funnel is industry-specific and priority-specific. Industry-specific meaning deals with prospects in retail &amp; restaurants, hospitality, aviation, etc. are not moving. It is also industry-specific in that a legal team or procurement team has never worked from home before so they just don&#8217;t know what to do and are working through it. On priority-specific, we are seeing huge deprioritization of non-essential initiatives. Classic ROI statements here &#8211; if you solve a cost problem and \/ or are work essentials (hardware, security, etc), you are in a better spot. If you are revenue-focused, then it&#8217;s really tough.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re seeing companies who are getting slowed down in the contracting process get creative with LOIs and pilots in order to move an engagement along and decrease time to value. Shortening\/simplifying implementation and lift required from the customer are key while companies are less organized and have less cross-team bandwidth in this remote environment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Post-sale<\/strong><br \/>\nWe\u2019re seeing companies get creative with payment terms in order to get deals done. Less upfront payments, more payment plans, discounts predicated on longer term agreements, etc. Current customers are asking for reduced pricing and delayed payments. The best companies are proactively working with their customers on pricing and payment terms that solve the customers\u2019 near-term challenges while also preserving their long-term pricing integrity. Applying the give-get framework with finesse is key here. If a company asks for a 20% discount, come up with a plan that gives them a short-term discount to help them through their near-term pain, while also gradually increasing pricing back to normal and negotiate an extension in the current contract term for your \u201cget\u201d in this scenario.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GTM Tweaks<\/strong><br \/>\nSellers are getting creative about honing their messaging to show their product as a need-to-have, cost-saving, easy-to-implement solution. We\u2019re seeing companies create new marketing collateral to elevate certain features and benefits, as well as repurpose parts of their product to solve a new, more-pressing customer pain point or use case. In parallel, companies are further refining their ICP and target buyer persona, focusing on the people that need their product the most with highly curated messaging. Overall, sellers are leaning in with value to build up good will down the road \u2013 ungating valuable content, organizing virtual webinars with valuable information for prospects, etc. Sales reps are also changing their tone &#8211; less pressure on prospects to sign a deal, more focus on providing immediate value and embracing the human element of sales.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Broad industry macro observations<\/strong><br \/>\n1. F2000 CIOs\/CTOs are focused on work essentials (hardware, endpoint security, cyber, networking, etc.) and then how they are going to spend stimulus money. They want to invest in the rebound and are focused on costs.<\/p>\n<p>2. Digital Transformation Acceleration \u2013 according to Deloitte, PWC, McKinsey QuantumBlack and others, business is likely to be off the charts. Everyone has to deal with finding more leverage, saving more money, etc. You will see <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/podcasts\/selling-into-digitalization-teams\/\" class=\"broken_link\">digital transformation<\/a> journeys accelerate.<\/p>\n<p>3. The widest barometer is Forrester and Gartner. They talk to F2000 CXOs. Andrew Bartels who is principal analyst at Forrester hasn&#8217;t really changed his software forecast but revised down pretty much everything else. Here is a breakdown: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/louiscolumbus\/2020\/03\/16\/covid-19s-impact-on-tech-spending-this-year\/#c36ea902d673\">link<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How are sales leaders responding?<\/strong><br \/>\nMost companies have recognized that they are not going to hit their numbers this quarter or this year. The best sales leaders are getting out in front of it:<\/p>\n<p>1. Thinking Weekly: Instead of giving Q2 forecasts\/goals, taking it week by week and adjusting on the fly given the fluidity of the situation. Looking at weekly pipeline changes and weekly activities vs. monthly.<\/p>\n<p>2. Quota Revisions: They have to be revised down. Less activities, less actions, less revenues. One sales community of 10,000 people indicated 70-80% of them were revising quotas down, mostly AEs.<\/p>\n<p>3. Re-thinking success: If deals are not going to close in the near-term, think about other ways to define success to keep your reps productive and <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/acceleration-team\/incentivizing-sales-teams\/\" class=\"broken_link\">motivated<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>4. Using leading indicators to talk through estimates: Speak in terms of &#8220;if we were to see this leading indicator hold&#8230;we could expect to hit X or Y revenue number.\u201d Most of this is budgets and business justification-based.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll continue to provide updates in the coming weeks on what we\u2019re seeing and how leaders are adapting their approach to sales during COVID-19.

This topic comes up frequently within the SaaS ecosystem because as Rick says, it\u2019s fairly intuitive for companies to think about sales capacity planning through the primary lens of <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/sales\/sales-hiring-formulas-in-saas-busineses\/\" class=\"broken_link\">hiring<\/a> additional sellers and increasing quotas. But does increasing sales headcount and quotas alone lead to continuous outsized returns? Rick brings tremendous expertise to this topic having worked his way up as an individual contributor, manager, and executive at companies like Intralinks and Greenhouse and now works with multiple fast-growing SaaS companies as a consultant.<\/p>\n<p>Rick Smolen is a passionate and results-focused Revenue Leader with over 20 years of experience in Technology and SaaS businesses.\u00a0 Most recently, Rick led Sales at Greenhouse Software where he oversaw the tripling of company recurring revenue in under three years.\u00a0 This was accomplished by building a world class sales leadership team and transforming the sales process and customer conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to joining Greenhouse, Rick spent over 12 years at Intralinks, a leading Fin-tech software company in a range of sales leadership and International roles helping to grow the company to over $300M in annual sales.\u00a0 He has also held multiple Sales roles at Thomson Financial and began his career in Finance at AlliedSignal. Rick is now continuously engaged in consulting work on behalf of the Revenue Collective, Force Management, and other fast growing SaaS businesses.\u00a0 Rick studied Finance at Penn State University and is an avid reader and runner.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/bowery-capital\/embed\/episodes\/Why-Your-Sales-Capacity-Plan-Doesnt-Work-with-Rick-Smolen-Intralinks-ebget1\" width=\"800px\" height=\"102px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In this episode, we start off by mapping out the basics of what is a sales capacity plan and dive into how this works in practice. Companies with a growth imperative spend a significant amount of time trying to figure out how they can add more sales capacity to hit lofty revenue goals. Rick observes that at some point this stops working and many companies continue to fall into the same trap of building their growth plans around how many Account Executives they can hire and how much quota they can allocate. We talked through some of the common planning mistakes companies make and then delved into how taking a bottom-up approach in building the top of the funnel can allow for more accurate projections with sales capacity planning.

We break the topic into a couple of buckets &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/podcasts\/building-your-first-pricing-model\/\" class=\"broken_link\">pricing<\/a> and sales process. Andy shares his insights on common mistakes SaaS companies make with their pricing strategy, including over-copying what competitors are doing and also not investing enough in discovery work (highly recommends the book \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/monetizinginnovation.com\/about-the-book\/\">Monetizing Innovation<\/a>\u201d for frameworks on how to figure out customers\u2019 willingness to pay). We discuss how to balance innovative pricing models with the \u201cold way\u201d your customers are used to buying. On the flip side, will buyers in antiquated industries eventually become so used to buying SaaS products that the current friction in first-time SaaS buyers goes away?<\/p>\n<p>In addition to pricing, it\u2019s also important to align your sales process with the way your customers want to buy. Andy mentions a common mistake he sees companies make is forcing a subscription SaaS solution on buyers who are really aren\u2019t set up to buy a subscription product (i.e. requires them to add steps to the approval process internally). Andy encourages companies to spend a lot of time in the discovery process to uncover the path of least resistance (and that path may not be a subscription product). We round out the discussion touching on tips for aligning your sales process with the buyer\u2019s preferred buying process, as well as how to drive urgency in your sales process while also respecting the customers&#8217; internal process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19549 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/0.jpg\" alt=\"Selling the Way Your Customers Want to Buy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/0.jpg 200w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/0-58x58.jpg 58w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Andy Wilson is Chief Executive Officer &amp; Cofounder at Logikcull.com, which he launched in 2004 with CTO and cofounder, Sheng Yang.

Zack sheds light on the difference between digitalization and innovation groups and why the distinction is important when it comes to selling into them. We discuss the different types of goals of digitalization teams depending on their mandate and how to uncover these goals throughout the discovery process. Zack stresses the importance of identifying the purpose of the digitalization or innovation team early on: is it a market research function, marketing\/employer branding exercise, corporate development, experimentation and pilot arm, etc. Not all digitalization teams are created equal, and so spend time to do the due diligence and determine whether the digitalization or innovation team of a particular company matches up with your <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/acceleration-team\/ideal-customer-profile-and-buyer-persona\/\" class=\"broken_link\">ICP<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Zack talks about how to think about leveraging the digitalization team even if they aren&#8217;t your Economic Buyer (which they likely aren&#8217;t). One important point to keep in mind is that at least one senior executive likely put their name, reputation, and budget behind creating a digitalization or innovation team. Uncovering who that person is internally can help you as you multi-thread and look for your forward-thinking champion(s) inside a large organization. Ultimately, these teams vary greatly between companies so do your homework and think of selling into digitalization and innovation teams as a single arrow in your holistic sales quiver. They might be an ICP, but they shouldn&#8217;t be your only ICP.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-19536 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/0-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Selling Into Digitalization and Innovation Teams\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/0-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/0-58x58.jpg 58w, https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/0.jpg 302w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>After a legal internship gone wrong during the aftermath of 2008&#8217;s housing crisis, Zack had a revelation: creating unique business ideas was far more attractive than responding to legal memos.

When done correctly, Channel Partnerships are a great way for early-stage companies to increase quality pipeline through a BD lead engine, boost credibility, reduce customer acquisition cost (CAC), all while staying close to the customer.<\/p>\n<p>Channel Partnerships break down into a few categories &#8211; reseller, alliance, affiliate, and referral partnerships. This blog series will focus on referral partnerships as they are often the most relevant to building your BD lead engine for early-stage startups. Why? Because they are generally applicable across industries, easy to set up, focus on building pipeline, and allow you to stay close to your prospects, which is absolutely critical in your early days when you are working on messaging, product\/market fit, confirming your ICP\/target buyer persona, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout this blog series on \u201cBuilding Your BD Lead Engine,\u201d we\u2019ll dig into when\/why\/how to get started, what type of organizations to partner with, how to build trust with partners, and how to make these partnerships successful over the long-haul. In this first post, we\u2019ll look at some of the most common mistakes startups make with their referral partnerships:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Signing the deal, thinking you\u2019re done, moving onto the next one<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Especially when you\u2019re first starting out, it may seem like a big win when you get your first referral partnership signed. You might be tempted to pop the champagne, high fives all around, and call it a day. Unfortunately, no matter how long it took you to get that agreement signed, this is only the beginning, not (even close to) the end. It\u2019s nice to think \u201cif you build it, they (aka the leads) will come,\u201d but you aren\u2019t Kevin Costner, and this isn\u2019t the Field of Dreams. Partnerships take effort, and you\u2019ll need to dedicate resources to launching and maintaining the partnership. This includes everything from figuring out who to engage, building up trust (across partner leadership and individual reps), getting them excited about the partnership, educating partner reps, making a splash in the market, collaborating on marketing\/events, and (most tiring of all) staying top of mind. We\u2019ll dig into all of this in subsequent posts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Not incentivizing the front line reps<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So you\u2019ve signed what you think is a lucrative rev-share deal for your partner. Surely they\u2019ll do everything they can to throw a bunch of qualified leads your way, right? Well&#8230;not so fast. What happens to the rev-share inside their org? Does it get shared with the individual rep (front line sales, account manager, solutions consultant, etc.)? Do they get quota retirement, cash spiffs, anything? These are the questions you should be asking your partner to make sure their reps (the people who have the power to refer you qualified leads) actually have an incentive to engage with you. Everybody is thinking \u201cwhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d and you need a strong answer to that question. Ideally your partner gives part of the rev-share to the rep, but if they won\u2019t introduce any type of individual rep incentive then you have to get creative. A rep sends you a great lead? Shoot them a gift card (think Amazon, not Red Lobster). That lead ends up signing a contract with your company? Send the rep another (these can even be in the $1000+ range depending on your deal size, make sure it\u2019s enough for them to care).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Allowing rev-share to extend in perpetuity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a SaaS company: $50k average ARR deal size, $5k implementation fee, and a services arm that can tack on $0-10k depending on the deal. Do your very best to limit the rev-share to Year 1 and not give in to multi-year, auto-renew on an upsell, or perpetual rev-share terms. You are better off giving up 15% rev-share just for Year 1 ARR vs. giving up 10% across Years 1, 2, and 3. If you get pushback on this, then be sure to introduce some kind of cap to protect yourself (and your margins). Implementation and service fees should be off the table &#8211; it\u2019s not standard for partners to get a piece of these.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Spending time with the wrong teams<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your partners are hopefully large, well established companies with a bazillion customers that are right in your ICP wheelhouse. Given that large companies serving large clients typically have at least dozens if not hundreds\/thousands of individual sales, account management, and solution consultant reps, you\u2019ll need to be strategic about where within a partner org you spend your time. You sell an enterprise product but you just spent an hour with your partner\u2019s SMB team? Congrats, you may feel accomplished, but really you just wasted your time. Leverage your partner champion to educate you on their org structure and be strategic about which teams\/reps you focus on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lack of planning around events<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Big partners have big budgets, which come in handy because conferences and events are expensive. Can\u2019t afford your own booth? Buddy up with a partner to see if you can offer some kind of promotion (exclusive to them and their clients\/prospects) in exchange for exposure at their booth\/event. Partners are always looking for ways to drive booth\/event traffic, so anything you can do that gives their clients a reason to stop by is a great value-add to offer your partner.

You can listen in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bnnbloomberg.ca\/the-real-economy\/helping-grocers-compete-by-giving-insight-into-what-consumers-want~1904165\">here<\/a>. We are happy to announce today that Bowery Capital led a Seed round of funding in the business late last year. Below lays out some more information and specifics on the round and our investment rationale.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Michael Brackett, founder and CEO of Centricity, created the company over a 20-year exposure to the supermarket industry. He had a colorful career that spanned stocking shelves up to the executive level. At Hannaford, Michael was a category manager who led a team of analysts to understand how consumer demand evolved over time. He was the youngest category manager at Ahold Delhaize, where he managed a $650M portfolio. Subsequently, he founded and bootstrapped BasketIQ, a CPG focused ad network that interjected partner brands at critical customer decision points. We first met Michael through another Bowery Capital founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DenehyXXL\">Ryan Denehy<\/a> the Founder &amp; CEO of Electric AI. Michael was exiting his prior company BasketIQ following an earn out and thinking hard about the evolution of the grocery and retail industries from a data and analytics standpoint. We valued his insights and expertise in the industry and stayed in touch. When he called us to talk about his new startup, it was a no brainer for us. We can&#8217;t predict the future here, but his insights and expertise really showcased to us the opportunity and created the &#8220;a-ha&#8221; moment. Mike was quickly\u00a0 joined by Jason Nichols, who is heading up engineering. Jason is the former Director of Artificial Intelligence for Walmart and spent many years thinking hard and building technology powering the grocery and retail industries. They were a natural fit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Centricity is a platform servicing the data needs of retailers and CPGs. While at the formation stage, the company intends to understand consumer buying preferences and anticipate potential consumer needs to optimize retail marketing operations. The product ingests almost a billion points of intent data and internet traffic daily, such as social media from platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, as well as search data &amp; e-commerce activity to preemptively predict trends in consumer consumption. As the product is further developed, Centricity will be able to incorporate front-end transactional data in real time. We think a lot at Bowery Capital about the legacy <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/insights\/2020-it-spending-forecasts\/\" class=\"broken_link\">replacement cycle<\/a> upon us in b2b. Competitive products such as Nielsen and IRi exist, but lag Centricity significantly in speed of delivering actionable insights while also only showing old purchase data. Most of the category managers we have spent time with in the past couple years have said as much. Cumbersome products will be replaced as the digital native takes ownership.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The thought wave of optimizing retail operations through data analytics has been around for some time now, but the implementation of solutions still lack nuance. We have tried to find Nielsen and iRI killers for a long time. Category managers we speak with still face frustration in the crude visibility provided by legacy products and this insufficiency of existing tools provides an opportunity in our view. Centricity as a platform platform empowers category managers to make more customer-centric decisions and increase sales by providing insights within meaningful timeframes, leveling the playing field with e-commerce disruptors such as Amazon. Centricity is currently on-boarding several multinational retailers &amp; CPG companies in to their beta program.

You\u2019ve pulled some long nights and looking back there were many times you weren\u2019t quite sure if you were going to be able to pull those couple of deals over the line in time, but you did it! You\u2019re exactly where you want to be and it was all worth it for this exact moment. But as they say, all good things come to an end and whether you\u2019re coming back from time off with the family, exotic travels, returning from the holiday break, or back in the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">office post your best ever SKO, reality sets in with the next quarter\/year\u2019s goals and you can\u2019t help but pause and wonder, will this ever get easier? With barely enough time to catch your breath, you\u2019re on to the next grind and surprise, you\u2019ve just found out that your quota has been raised and your comp plan isn\u2019t changing. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, this was somewhat expected, but what is this number\u2026 How did they even land on this number, did they pull it out of the sky?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the reality often faced by<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> successful sales <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">professionals in their roles, particularly in early-stage startups. As revenue goals become loftier and sales teams are pushed to the very limits of their capabilities, the stressors on mental health can become even more taxing. Particularly when targets can feel arbitrary, there can be a loss of purpose and accomplishment. In Matt&#8217;s experience, unpacking expectations around these numbers can help significantly alleviate mental health stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt started his sales career at Amazon, engaging with SMBs through the Amazon platform. Though he really enjoyed the role and felt it was a fantastic introduction to sales, he admits it wasn\u2019t the most engaging position. A typical 9 to 6 job, he clocked in, dialed between 100 and 150 numbers a day, and clocked out. By about 6 months in, he felt that he wasn\u2019t in the best position to learn and grow, feeling more like a cog in a wheel than a key player. As Matt decided to explore new career possibilities, he felt particularly attracted to the startup culture. Specifically, he wanted to be part of a company where he could sit in the same room as the\u00a0 CEO and Co-founders and learn how they interacted with customers firsthand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt dove into his search and methodically combed through companies. He had multiple conversations with folks in his network, and he was laser focused on finding a place that met his criteria and more. Given his limited early stage experience at the time, it was quite the journey and one that Matt eventually decided to give up on and reroute. A day after this decision, a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mutual connection introduced him to Greenhouse and, serendipitously, it hit all of the marks. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When they decided to give him a shot, he lea<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pt at the opportunity following the wise words of Eric Schmidt, \u201cwhen someone offers you a seat on a rocketship, you don\u2019t ask which seat, you just get on board.\u201d It was exactly what he had been searching for, and he buckled down with a renewed hunger to succeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Mental Health Management &#8211; Consider the Big Picture<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Matt\u2019s biggest challenges during his successful tenure at Greenhouse was after the first year they instituted formalized yearly quotas. He blew his number out of the water and was then tasked with an increased individual quota. Despite finishing the year strong, he couldn\u2019t help but feel somewhat exhausted. He was basically back at square one, his work-life balance was nonexistent (although admittedly somewhat self-inflicted), and this did not help his feelings of being disconnected from decisions around his quota.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he moved into a managerial role, however, Matt realized that these numbers are derived primarily from investor expectations and his VP of Sales relied on him to deliver on them. Understanding how a business operates, what the CEO is looking at, what investors are looking at, and unpacking expectations around sales targets helped Matt develop a more holistic view of how his sales efforts contributed to the com<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pany. He suggests that wherever possible, especially at an early stage startup, unpack expectations with your sales team. It can result in feeling an increased sense of ownership and understanding instead of feelings of anxiety and resentment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Mental Health Management &#8211; Prioritize Rest<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s become an unfortunate modern phenomenon to brag about how little sleep we get as a result of our hard work. Long weeks at work in cities that don\u2019t sleep, such as New York, can lead to big weekends as a way to blow off steam, starting as early as Thursday night. Matt shares that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he had a reputation at Greenhouse, that no matter how late they were out, he was in the office at 7 AM the next day. While optically it came across as him showing up, it actually magnified the stressors of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of founders emphasize how little sleep they can operate effectively on. While some people may require less sle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ep than the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepfoundation.org\/articles\/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need\">recommended 7-9 hours<\/a>,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0strivin<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">g to manage your schedule effectively can have a much more positive impact on your daily workflow. Matt suggests that prioritizing sleep and taking the time to map out your week can be a huge asset when it comes to productivity. While time spent sleeping may seem like it takes time away from work, it actually enhances productivity and gives you time back in the day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Top Tips for Managing Mental Health: Pick Your Battles\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Matt\u2019s top tips for managing mental health is to focus on picking your battles rather than pursuing every possible opportunity. There is a tim<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e and a place to put your nose to the grindstone, but the reality is, most conversations and chasing can wait till the next morning. The majority of people don\u2019t expect you to be on call at 10 PM. There may be a sort of badge of honor associated with signing a contract at 10 PM, but th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at\u2019s not really conducive to your own long-term healt<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">h. Yes, at a startup you need to grind and push, but use your best judgment; if working 24\/7 doesn\u2019t serve you or your company\u2019s best interests, then reconsider giving yourself some guardrails, e.g. no emails on Saturdays so you can take some time to unplug and recharge.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt also suggests that having a mentor <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is extremely important to the mental aspect of sales. He believes that learning through someone else\u2019s experience can empower you to be better equipped to navigate specific work\/life balance challenges. While Matt has had several mentors by way of former managers, he more recently found that the best type of mentor for him is a life coach. While former managers know him really well and provide extremely helpful insight, their breadth of advice is narrowed by their perspective of him and could limit his ability to grow<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> beyond their expectations. H<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aving a life coach who is a third party to his work and life has proved to be a great outlet and as he returning to the workforce, Matt is planning to retain his as an ongoing resource. As an unbiased third party, a life coach can help with unpacking expectations from your managers as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>If you liked \u201cMental Health at Early-Stage Startups: Unpacking Expectations\u201d and want to read more content from the Bowery Capital Team, check out other relevant posts from the <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/\"><i>Bowery Capital Blog<\/i><\/a><i>.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to our fourth installment in our series on mental health at early-stage startups.

At 19, he ran his first six-figure business painting houses while attending school at Oregon State University. He&#8217;s worked with hundreds of sales reps and personally closed millions of dollars in revenue during his career. At Blissful Prospecting, he&#8217;s in charge of growing the company through marketing and sales efforts. In his free time, Jason also enjoys stand up comedy, reading, traveling, hiking, and geeking out on productivity tips.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/bowery-capital\/embed\/episodes\/Outbound-3-0-with-Jason-Bay-Blissful-Prospecting-eavq8i\" width=\"800px\" height=\"102px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>We start the podcast learning some SaaS sales lessons from Jason&#8217;s early days building a painting business. We then get into how to determine whether to outsource your outbound efforts or hire a full-time SDR as an early-stage startup (TLDR: have you already figured out your messaging\/product market fit? If no, don&#8217;t outsource). Jason sheds light on this new concept of Outbound 3.0 &#8211; the next evolution of outbound that requires companies to cut through the clutter. There are three components to do this effectively: i) identify good fit accounts and contacts, ii) engage them with simple conversation starters, and iii) convert them to opportunities and move them through the sales funnel. There&#8217;s a distinct shift from mass blast to quality and from product-centric messaging to buyer-centric messaging. Companies can excel in this new era of outbound 3.0 through content, thoughtful multi-channel\/multi-touch outreach cadences, and using conversational messaging.<\/p>\n<p>We discuss how to determine the level of <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/sales\/sales-personalization\/\">personalization<\/a> in your outbound efforts based on ACV. Next, we get into how to balance customization with volume and specific tactical suggestions around your cadences, segmentation, subject lines, and calls to action.\u00a0When it comes to your cadences, Jason suggests 12 to 15 touches over 30-45 days with messaging spread out over 2-3 distinct value props. Jason also breaks down how to think about your sales tech stack in the early days (he&#8217;s a big fan of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apollo.io\">Apollo.io<\/a>). For subject lines, Jason suggests you keep it short, use the prospect&#8217;s first name, or try using three words that are relevant but seemingly unrelated to pique their interest (&#8220;Initiative, 2020, Company Name&#8221;). When it comes to the call to action, a big mistake SDRs make is asking for a meeting too early &#8211; can I have 30min of your time? Jason suggests slowing down and making your email easier to respond to: is this something worth chatting about; is this a challenge you&#8217;re having right now; is this something that is on your radar?<\/p>\n<p>Jason shares some of the top mistakes outbound teams make in the early days and how to avoid them. These include buying the wrong tools (and too early), lack of coaching and training, lack of collaboration (especially around messaging), and lack of outsourcing (list building, prospect research, etc. &#8211; he recommends <a href=\"https:\/\/taskdrive.com\/\">TaskDrive<\/a>). Jason sees outbound teams being too <em>assumptive<\/em> today about what a prospect is focused on and what a prospect cares about. Another common mistake is that SDRs will start with a personalized sentence or two, but then won&#8217;t connect it to the rest of the email. It is important to tie it all together to make it relevant and genuine.<\/p>\n<p>Another topic we discussed is setting the right goals for your outbound efforts. Jason advises you should aim to set up a meeting with 3-6% of the accounts you are reaching out to and work backwards from there (reply rates of 5%+ and open rates of 50-60%+).<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, Jason created a framework called the REPLY method to help create a 5-step process for writing cold emails\/cold call scripts, and he put together an easy one-page cheatsheet that you can access <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blissfulprospecting.com\/evan\">here<\/a>. His biggest tip on how to prospect effectively? Lead with curiosity and don&#8217;t be assumptive about what the prospect wants or cares about.<\/p>\n<p><em>If you liked \u201cOutbound 3.0\u201d and want to read more content from the Bowery Capital Team, check out other relevant posts from the <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/\"><em>Bowery Capital Blog<\/em><\/a><em>.

We were joined by Assaf Resnick, Founder &amp; CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigpanda.io\/\">BigPanda<\/a>, to discuss best practices for mastering the complex enterprise IT sale. We spoke about his journey from an investor at Sequoia Capital to starting and scaling BigPanda and the lessons learned along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Assaf Resnick is the Founder &amp; CEO of BigPanda. He enjoys uptime, freetime and cheesecake. Previous to founding BigPanda, Assaf was an investor with Sequoia Capital.

We go into the sales process in the early days as BigPanda was coming out of stealth mode, as well as the key early learnings that led to them locking in product market fit. After a year and a half with their initial inside sales strategy, BigPanda took a step back and reflected on which customers were getting the most value out of the platform and shifted their sales strategy towards enterprise. We then covered how to navigate enterprise sales while working on enterprise hardening the product. Assaf expanded on the various steps a company goes through when mastering the enterprise IT sale, and gave us insight into BigPanda&#8217;s approach to enterprise sales today and what that sales process looks like. Next, we dug deeper into qualification (i.e. not just asking if a buyer has budget, but digging into whether they have CapEx vs. OpEx and why it matters), followed by how to cultivate champions in a middle-up sales approach. We go into the various stages of an enterprise sale, where people can get stuck, and how to make sure your product is providing meaningful business value. We then get into the importance of scoping a POV to align it to business pain vs. focusing solely on impressive technical specifications.

Read our previous post <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/talent\/mental-health-at-early-stage-startups-managing-burnout\/\" class=\"broken_link\">here<\/a> with Justin Welsh. For this post, we spoke with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/kristen-habacht\" class=\"broken_link\">Kristen Habacht<\/a>, Global Head of Enterprise Development Sales (previously VP of Sales) at <a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/en-US\">Trello<\/a>, about how sharing your journey can help with managing stress and mental health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do\u2026 Use your success, wealth and influence to put them in the best position to realize their own dreams and find their true purpose.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2015 Kobe Bryant\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is easy to forget that your boss, mentor, or role model began their career in a role far below their current position. But when you think about it, we all had to start from somewhere and there are many paths to success, often filled with ups, downs, and several hurdles along the way. While career progression is a personal accolade in our work lives, it can often take a toll on our mental health. From experiencing a loss in expertise, to fear of soaring expectations, to potential feelings of imposter syndrome, the path to success is typically zig-zagged. The concept of storytelling and sharing your journey is often overlooked as a useful tool for proactively managing mental health. Could success feel more attainable if more people knew that there wasn\u2019t a straight and narrow path to growing their careers?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristen Habacht got her start in sales in a rather non-traditional manner. Her first job out of college was an office administrator at a security startup that was quite far removed from sales. One of the advantages of working at a startup, however, was that the CEO noticed Kristen\u2019s excellent work ethic and drive to succeed and offered her an opportunity to transfer to the sales team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to being excited about being in a sales role, Kristen was particularly attracted to the opportunity to have a real impact on the firm and a potentially outsized set of responsibilities as a result of the lean team. During her extensive career, she has found that one of the keys to managing mental health is sharing your journey with others and promoting that no two paths will be identical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Mental Health Management &#8211; Distribute Your Day<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You would never guess from her resume but something Kirsten struggled with earlier in her career was a job that required an extremely long commute from her home in Connecticut to Manhattan, 2.5 hours each way. She left her home before the sun rose, and arrived back home after nightfall, only finding time with her family on the weekends. After maintaining this lifestyle for two years, it occurred to her that all of her discussions and relationships centered around work. She never unplugged as a result of her extreme commute that unsurprisingly left her with no time for other activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon recognizing the severity of the commute\u2019s impact on her mental health and how it amplified the stressors she experienced in her job, Kristen realized the importance of distributing her energy into different activities. Dedicating time towards her passions such as community theatre and book clubs helped her alleviate the stress experienced in her day-to-day. As a result of her personal experiences, something Kristen really focuses on is role modeling by sharing her experiences with her team so they feel encouraged to develop and share their hobbies outside of the workplace.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Mental Health Management &#8211; Own Your Career<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work can easily start to creep up into other aspects of your life unknowingly. A call with Europe at 7 AM, a touchpoint with Asia at 10 PM. As these begin to compound, it can feel as though control of your life is slipping away, leading to feelings of stress and mental distress. Given her high drive to succeed, Kristen keenly felt this pressure as she stepped up to build her global team at Atlassian. Once she realized she was expecting twins, Kristen took the reigns of her schedule back into her own hands. Setting guardrails on her calendar and taking more vacations are some of the ways Kristen has been able to control her time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For managers, it can be particularly important to show their team that it is okay to own their time and control their schedules. On a related note, the ability to own their own time can help alleviate feelings of imposter syndrome. In her experience, Kristen has had colleagues who have refused promotions resulting from a lack of confidence and belief in their ability to take the next step. Kirsten, however, strongly believes that taking control and steering your schedule can help boost confidence and alleviate mental health burdens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristen highlights that, as a manager, sharing your journey is critical to demonstrate to other team members that success can be achieved through building their careers with their own unique paths.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Top Tip for Managing Mental Health: Seek Feedback Often<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristen\u2019s top tip for managing mental health is to engage with your managers and proactively seek feedback. Feedback can often have a negative connotation because it requires us to be somewhat vulnerable to how others perceive us. It can, however, be helpful to realize that constructive feedback is a positive sign rather than negative as it reflects thoughtfulness and willingness to invest time and effort in the team member. On her part, Kristen believes that if she had been more proactive in seeking feedback, she would have accelerated her career by a few years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important as well to ask for feedback in an appropriate manner that can be pointed in a specific direction. Asking for blank feedback gives managers no direction and doesn\u2019t reflect proactive engagement. Kristen suggests asking more pointed questions such as how could they have performed better in a specific situation, what are some resources they could leverage to learn more, and could they sit in on additional meetings, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>If you liked \u201cMental Health at Early-Stage Startups: Sharing Your Journey\u201d and want to read more content from the Bowery Capital Team, check out other relevant posts from the <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/\"><i>Bowery Capital Blog<\/i><\/a><i>.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to our third installment in our series on mental health at early stage startups.

Each year, The Bridge Group puts out a great survey of almost 300 companies focused on AE metrics that matter. The report is chock full of data and benchmarking. It is excellent for any founder, sales operations team, or revenue leader in helping understand things like quota, compensation, organizational design, specific AE metrics, and various sales leadership components. Matt joined us on the podcast to talk through the 7th edition of the report that came out this week. Give it a listen and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.bridgegroupinc.com\/saas-inside-sales-metrics\">download the report<\/a>. A special thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/blog\/sales\/founder-led-selling\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Pete Kazanjy<\/a> for the introduction to Matt!<\/p>\n<p>Matt is responsible for crunching numbers, analyzing models, and architecting tech stacks. If you&#8217;ve ever heard a Bridge Group stat, you&#8217;ve encountered Matt&#8217;s work. He also leads internal revenue operations and keeps the home fire burning. Matt bleeds podcasts, books, and big ideas. He is never short an answer to the question, \u201cRead or hear anything interesting lately?\u201d As a former Marriott Front Desk Manager, Matt has the distinction of having been howled at by brides, Brown University parents, WWE wrestlers, and soccer\/hockey\/cheer parents. Years of abuse taught Matt that empathy and laser-like focus on buyers&#8217; goals are paramount. Matt started his technology sales career with SDR and AE positions at Sophos, Certified Backup, and AmeriVault. Previously, Matt held a product marketing role at Venyu (now EATEL).<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/bowery-capital\/embed\/episodes\/AE-Metrics-That-Matter-with-Matt-Bertuzzi-Bridge-Group-eaif4h\" width=\"800px\" height=\"102px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Matt and I started out the show talking through the general gist of the report and why you should care. The Bridge Group has put this report out a bunch so Matt talked a bit about how it expanded this year. In addition, he walked through some of the key changes for the 2020 edition and what they removed. We then walked through key highlights within the report and how to consider this as an individual contributor, manager, and executive. Matt talked a bit about the AE metrics that matter and some surprises from the report around compensation, leadership, and organizational design. We then dug in and focused on the five key areas of the report. First we talked about organizational structure and what is trending in terms of the AE &lt;&gt; SDR organization design as well as how marketing plays an ever increasing role in the sales function. Second, we talked about ramp and retention and how to think about experience of your reps in this context. Third, we ran through metrics and quota. This was the meat of the data and any AE or CEO should review this section to benchmark their own organization. Fourth, we talked about compensation and where the market is at today.

We\u2019re excited to share that several of our 2019 host companies are returning in 2020 and we\u2019ll also be introducing a few new startups this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back on 2019, we took some time to sit down with three of our recent grads, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ygurditta\/\">Yash Gurditta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/elizaloftus\/\">Eliza Loftus<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sammy-stern-b16bb7110\/\">Sammy Stern<\/a> and get their thoughts on the Bowery Capital Fellowship Program. But before we dive in, here are some highlights from the Class of 2019:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-75% of recent grads received full-time offers to join their host company post fellowship<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-25% of recent grads received full-time offers outside of the program to start immediately post fellowship<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2 of our mentor\/mentee matches are still going strong<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Fun fact: 1 fellowship mentor was hired as a full-time employee at Bowery<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>As a recent grad, what made you decide to pursue the Fellowship instead of a full-time position?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Y:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It was definitely tough deciding between going into a full-time role and participating in a summer fellowship with no guaranteed next steps. Ultimately, it came down to the exposure I knew I&#8217;d get through my involvement in the fellowship. I knew meeting leadership across several different SaaS companies in NYC would be helpful in my career long term and that I would learn a lot about the tech ecosystem. I kept in mind that full-time roles are available all the time and that the same could not be said for summer fellowships like Bowery Capital\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>S:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was also definitely a little hesitant about the Bowery Capital Fellowship Program at first since I had just graduated and was primarily looking for full-time employment. By no means was it an easy decision for me to choose the Fellowship over the security of a full-time role, especially since it required me to move to a whole new city. I believe what ultimately led me to choosing the fellowship came down to two things. The first reason was the type of companies that the fellowship had the ability to connect me with. I always wanted to work in New York City and I always envisioned myself working at a fast-growth startup. The second reason was the networking possibilities that the Fellowship offers. I believe that many people do not understand the importance of networking until much later in their careers. However, being able to make connections at Bowery and all the other host companies is an unbelievable way to begin your career.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>E:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think Sales is a scary field because there are so many stereotypes. I thought it was what I wanted to do, but didn\u2019t want to end up in a cut-throat environment, crunching to hit my numbers, always worrying about being laid off, with no passion (the typical stereotypes!). The fellowship allowed me to explore the field of sales while gaining connections and insights into how sales teams are structured. It also allowed me to see what type of sales environment I wanted to work in and what was important to me for my first full-time job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How would you describe the Fellowship?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>E:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I would describe the fellowship as an amazing stepping stone for someone who thinks they want to work in sales at a tech start-up. The fellowship gives you invaluable insights that otherwise could not be gained.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>S: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say that it&#8217;s an incredibly unique and valuable way to begin your career. Although it may not be traditional, and you could even say \u201cless safe\u201d than a traditional job, the value that you can get out of the fellowship is limitless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Y:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The program is designed to teach aspiring professionals how SaaS companies generate and retain revenue by meeting leaders in the industry while gaining hands on experience at a host company. The combination of weekly teach-ins and a full-time internship made the experience of going through the fellowship really engaging and well rounded.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What resources should future Fellows take advantage of and focus on in the duration of their Fellowship?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>S:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I would say that future Fellows should make sure to take advantage of just networking as much as possible. Whether this is making connections at Bowery, or the host companies that you visit, just make sure that you take advantage of all the value that the fellowship can offer you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>E: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fully engage each week at \u2018Coffee with Closers\u2019, ask questions and soak it all in. The meetings, if you take advantage of them, can give you an insider\u2019s perspective on what it would be like to work at each company. They also give you insights into what you like in a sales team &#8211; size, structure, goals, etc. and these can be applied to any job in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Y: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t worry too much about finding a full-time role. Oftentimes, your host company will extend you a return offer. If you choose to go a different route and pursue different opportunities, focus on what really interests you. Give yourself options and go with what feels right for you. The fellowship is designed to help you succeed and the people involved with the program are willing to help you figure it out &#8211; just ask.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>A tradition we have at Bowery is to share our peak and pit &#8211; how would you describe yours?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>E: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My pit was not knowing if I would have a full-time offer when the fellowship ended. At times I questioned if I should have just gone the traditional route and accepted a full-time offer, but I am so grateful that I completed the fellowship. So with that, my peak was finding a company that I love! If I had not done the fellowship I wouldn\u2019t have discovered Ceros and found a job and company that I love! Also, it\u2019s a plus that I have so many connections in tech now \ud83d\ude42\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Y:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The pit and the peak of the program were the same. 8 AM Coffee with Closers. It was easily the most engaging and eye-opening part of the program as it helped me see the big picture and inspired me to pursue a full-time role in sales. But also, showing up alert and ready to learn at 8 AM every week was a struggle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>S:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I would say that the peak of the program was just getting going to all the other host companies every week. Every company taught me something different and being able to see all the other offices and learning about other companies was really a great experience. I would say the pit of the program was just not having the job security that a full-time role was. However, I never really let that affect me personally, as I knew what I had signed up for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>Interested in applying for our 2020 Bowery Capital Fellowship Program?<\/em><\/strong> Applications will be open through to February 15th and you can apply directly on our <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/fellowship.bowerycap.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

So I decided to put pen to paper, or rather Arial to WordPress, and recap what led me to this career move.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>With any career transition, it\u2019s essentially a culmination of where you\u2019ve been and where you\u2019re trying to go. For me, the \u201cwhere I\u2019ve been\u201d began with J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong where I started my career as a stock broker. The goal was to live in an interesting place, meet interesting people, and get exposed to a wide range of industries (through following stock markets) and see which one(s) I was interested in. I experienced first-hand how software and technology reshaped the financial services industry, and quickly realized that it was just a matter of time before all other industries went through a similar shift in orbit as a result of technological innovation, B2B SaaS being one of the primary drivers. I also learned that I wanted to be part of \u201cthe action,\u201d not just commenting from the sidelines while watching other people build great companies and innovate.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Next stop, my foray into B2B SaaS. A quick 17-hour flight landed me in New York City, where I joined the sales team at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rocketrip.com\">Rocketrip<\/a>, a business travel tech startup. The goal was to earn my SaaS sales chops, as well as learn as much as possible about how to grow a business. Over the next 3+ years, I spent time in Sales, Strategy &amp; Ops, Product Management, and ultimately Business Development and Partnerships. Each role building on the next, it was an incredible learning curve and got me addicted to start-ups. The constant problem solving, collaboration, we\u2019ll-figure-out-a-way mentality had me hooked, and I now wanted to broaden my impact and apply my learnings to help a multitude of founders grow their businesses. Enter: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bowerycap.com\" class=\"broken_link\">Bowery Capital<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>There were four key reasons why I joined Bowery Capital:<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>1. Bowery Capital\u2019s mission is incredibly simple: modernize business through technology investing<\/strong>. This really resonated with me because of my prior experiences at JPM (a business that had been modernized through tech) and Rocketrip (a business that was doing the modernizing).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>2. Hands-on approach Bowery Capital takes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bowerycap.com\/value-add\/\" class=\"broken_link\">adding value<\/a><\/strong><strong> for its portfolio companies.<\/strong> They don\u2019t just write a check, they become real partners with their founders and go the extra mile to help them succeed. I relished being in the trenches at Rocketrip, and so I am excited to roll up my sleeves and work with our founders to get them from Series Seed to Series A and beyond. A lot of VCs say this, but it was clear that the Bowery Capital team lives it and treats it as a core tenant to how the firm operates and invests resources.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>3. Bowery team takes an extremely selective and thoughtful approach when choosing founders to back.<\/strong> I strive to surround myself with high-caliber people (both internally and externally), and have a lot of confidence in the folks that Bowery invests in. Although <a href=\"https:\/\/bowerycap.com\/portfolio\/\" class=\"broken_link\">their portfolio<\/a> speaks for itself, this became even more apparent after meeting some of their portfolio company founders throughout the process.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>4. Bowery team is second-to-none.<\/strong> I was initially drawn to the firm because my former colleague and friend, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jessicabernido\/\">Jess Bernido<\/a>, is Bowery\u2019s Director of Talent and would be my counterpart on the Acceleration Team. I think very highly of Jess and the quality of her work, so the opportunity to work closely with her again was enticing. As I got to know the rest of the Bowery team, I realized there isn\u2019t a better group I could surround myself with to learn, grow, and contribute in this next phase of my career.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>My goal this time around is to learn the VC side of tech, get broader exposure to the inner workings of startups (i.e. work with founders, board observer, etc.), and ultimately get a better sense of whether I want to become a founder, an operator, or commit to a career in VC. I\u2019m confident that breaking into VC platform and joining Bowery Capital is the best way for me to achieve these goals, which is why I\u2019m thrilled to have joined the team! I have an enormous amount of respect for entrepreneurs, and I am incredibly excited to work closely with our entrepreneurs in this role.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s my third day in seat and I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions from my network about why I joined the Bowery Capital team and what my experience was like breaking into VC platform.
